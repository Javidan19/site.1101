    <h1>Project 1: How Does Hardware Work?</h1>

    <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>University:</strong> ADA University</li>
        <li><strong>Major:</strong> Information Technologies and Engineering</li>
        <li><strong>Course:</strong> SITE1101 – Principles of Information Systems</li>
        <li><strong>Tools Used:</strong> HTML, CSS, GitHub</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This project was created as part of the SITE1101 course. The goal of the project
        is to understand the basic components of computer hardware and how they work together
        to process information.
    </p>

    <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
    <p>
        The CPU is the main component of a computer responsible for processing instructions
        and performing calculations. It controls most operations inside the system.
    </p>

    <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
    <p>
        RAM is temporary memory that stores data while programs are running. It allows
        the computer to access information quickly and improves performance.
    </p>

    <h2>Storage</h2>
    <p>
        Storage devices such as hard drives and solid-state drives are used to store data
        permanently. The data remains saved even when the computer is turned off.
